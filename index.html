  <h2>You're So Creepy - Ghost Town</h2>

  <p> Lyric Exerpt:
      <br> "For once why can't you just come and chase me
Dig up my grave and save my body
Now I'm rotting to the bone
But my heart's still beating
Hoping you won't leave me
Creepy girls, you're just my style
Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile
Falling victim to your fantasy
Damn, I love it that you're so creepy" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/ghosts.jpeg" id="ghosts" alt="Ghosts Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2> Ghosts - Jacob Tillberg</h2>

  <p> Lyric Exerpt:
      <br> "Do you remember that day in October?
The leaves were falling just like me when it was over
One more day of sorrow and I'll struggle to stay sober
Hope to see you later when I get older
I still remember the smell of your perfume
It hasn't left me since the day you made me blue
I think I saw you but I know I'm not supposed to
I must be dreaming 'cause I don't believe in ghosts" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/witch.jpg" id="witch" alt="October Country Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >My Girlfriend Is A Witch - October Country</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
    <br> "Riding high
Leaving trails of smoke across the sky
On a broom
Glad that I am safe within my room
I know my girlfriend is a witch
Spells fill the air
I think I hear footsteps on my stair
Coming near
Her thoughts are telling me that she's here"</p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/lights.jpg" id="lights" alt="Good And Evil Album Cover Art" class="album"/>
  <h2 >Turn The Lights Off - Tally Hall</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
    <br>  "Don't go in there
You'll become one
Freaky creatures
Monster party
Eyes of yellow
Scales and feathers
Tails in tethers
Turn the lights off
Bend the nightmare
You control it
Artful dodger
Easy does it
Shut the closet
Get under the covers
Snakes and lovers
Turn the lights off" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/obsessed.jpg" id="obsessed" alt="The Orion Experience Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >Obsessed With You - The Orion Experience</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
    <br> "I've got your picture on my wall
I dream about you when I sleep
I go out of my way everyday just hoping that
I'll catch you walking down the street
I know just where you went to school
I know the names of all your friends
I got it bad again
An o-b-s-e-s-s-i-o-n
I know your middle name
I got a lock of your hair
I'm just a little bit insane
'Cause I think I see you everywhere
My friends, they just don't understand
They cannot see my point of view
They say it's gotten outta hand
And I'm obsessed with you
" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/necromancin.jpg" id="necromancing" alt="Blasterpiece Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >Necromancin' Dancin' - Bear Ghost</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
<br>   "This is it
Now we've found it, I'm astounded
Every town will be surrounded
By a throng of marchin' death
Delicious the riches, they glisten ahead
It's a craze
They'll devour every hour
Of these endless, non-progressive inundations of their kind
And lucky for you, you're the next one in line
When I'm necromancin', everyone's dancin'
No one can stop me, I dare you to try
The dead are infused with sensational groove
And they're comin' for you now
There's nowhere to hide
Yeah (waltzin' forth, here they come)
I'm raisin' the dead (everyone turn and run)
I'm lovin' the dread (killer moves that will stun)
Let's make some evil
" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/dead.jpg" id="dead" alt="Heartworms Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >Dead Alive - The Shins</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
    <br> "On a walk in a fragile state
Weird angles coming over the wire
Back home we got girls in braids and they're on
Roller skates and they roll any way they like
From my town I can always look down
Down from my nose to the fish in the barrels
But in the wiles of human life
There are pity nights and a ray of gentle eyes
So tonight
Dance and cry
You're dead alive
" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/hallows.jpg" id="hallows" alt="Howling At The Moon Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >All Hallows - Aviators</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
    <br>  "Still air, the harvest moon in the sky
Fools scared of their supernatural demise
Raised hair on the back of your neck
Tells you something is lurking tonight
The hymns of the October wind are howling through the trees
The sun sets on a night to bring the bravest to their knees
A thin divide is lifted letting spirits through the fray
When shadows fall the beasts have come to scare us all away
Dark saints
All hallows
The villains hunt before they're off to the gallows on a
Cursed night
A bone chiller
Cover your eyes, 'cause you're living a thriller" </p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/wolves.jpg" id="wolves" alt="All My Demons Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >Running With The Wolves - Aurora</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
  <br> "Go row the boat to safer grounds
But don't you know we're stronger now
My heart still beats and my skin still feels
My lungs still breathe, my mind still fears
But we're running out of time
Oh, all the echoes in my mind cry
There's blood on your lies
The sky's open wide
There is nowhere for you to hide
The hunter's moon is shining
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves
I'm running with the wolves tonight
I'm running with the wolves"</p>

<br> </br>

  <img src="images/creature.jpeg" id="creature" alt="Black Box Album Cover Art" class="album" />
  <h2 >Creature Of The Night - Air Traffic Controller</h2>

<p> Lyric Exerpt:
  <br>"I am a creature of the night
It's the only thing that feels right
Yeah, it's the only way that I get by
I hope you don't mind
Not as inspired in the daylight
I'm too distracted by everything in sight
If I just wait until everybody says goodnight
I'll get it done right
Midnight comes around there's no way I am laying down
I'm on a roll, I'm in control
I've got to keep the oil burning
And my little wheels a-turning up the road
It's all I know" </p>
