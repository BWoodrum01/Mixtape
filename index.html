           For once why can't you just come and chase me <br>
          Dig up my grave and save my body<br>
          Now I'm rotting to the bone<br>
          But my heart's still beating<br>
          Hoping you won't leave me<br>
          Creepy girls, you're just my style<br>
          Blood-red lipstick, you don't smile<br>
          Falling victim to your fantasy<br>
          Damn, I love it that you're so creepy </p>

          <br> Do you remember that day in October?<br>
          The leaves were falling <br>just like me when it was over<br>
          One more day of sorrow <br>and I'll struggle to stay sober<br>
          Hope to see you later when I get older<br>
          I still remember the smell of your perfume<br>
          It hasn't left me since the day you made me blue<br>
          I think I saw you but I know I'm not supposed to<br>
          I must be dreaming 'cause I don't believe in ghosts</p>

          Leaving trails of smoke across the sky
          On a broom<br>
          Glad that I am safe within my room<br>
          I know my girlfriend is a witch<br>
          Spells fill the air<br>
          I think I hear footsteps on my stair<br>
          Coming near<br>
          Her thoughts are telling me that she's here</p>

          Shut the closet<br>

          I know just where you went to school<br>

          My friends, they just don't understand<br>

          Now we've found it, I'm astounded<br>
          Every town will be surrounded<br>
          By a throng of marchin' death<br>
          Delicious the riches, they glisten ahead<br>
          It's a craze<br>
          They'll devour every hour<br>
          Of these endless, non-progressive inundations of their kind<br>
          And lucky for you, you're the next one in line<br>
          When I'm necromancin', everyone's dancin'<br>
          No one can stop me, I dare you to try<br>
          The dead are infused with sensational groove<br>
          And they're comin' for you now<br>
          There's nowhere to hide<br>
          Yeah <br>(waltzin' forth, here they come)<br>
          I'm raisin' the dead <br>(everyone turn and run)<br>
          I'm lovin' the dread <br>(killer moves that will stun)<br>

          <br> On a walk in a fragile state<br>
          Weird angles coming over the wire<br>
          Back home we got girls in braids and they're on<br>
          Roller skates and they roll any way they like<br>
          From my town I can always look down<br>
          Down from my nose to the fish in the barrels<br>
          But in the wiles of human life<br>
          There are pity nights and a ray of gentle eyes<br>
          So tonight<br>
          Dance and cry<br>
          You're dead alive </p>

          Fools scared of their supernatural demise<br>
          Raised hair on the back of your neck<br>
          Tells you something is lurking tonight<br>
          The hymns of the October wind are howling through the trees<br>
          The sun sets on a night to bring the bravest to their knees<br>
          A thin divide is lifted letting spirits through the fray<br>
          When shadows fall the beasts have come to scare us all away<br>
          Dark saints<br>
          All hallows<br>
          The villains hunt before they're <br> off to the gallows on a<br>
          Cursed night<br>
          A bone chiller <br>
          Cover your eyes,<br> 'cause you're living a thriller </p>
